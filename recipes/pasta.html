    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For this quick and easy recipe we will be making a simple fresh tomato sauce <em>while</em> the pasta is cooking.</p>
    <p>You most likely have all of the necessary ingredients sitting in your pantry right now, and if not then the recipe is <strong>easily changeable</strong>!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For a serving size of 3-4 plates <em>(or if you're me and eat the entire thing in one serving)</em>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>250 gr. Spaghetti pasta (or any pasta of your choice)</li>
        <li>Around 20 cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Regular tomatoes</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Optional: Chilli flakes</li>
        <li>Handful of basil</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the pasta in a pot filled with <em>generously salted</em> boiling water. Cooking time should be between 7-10 minutes, depending on pot size, pasta type, and cooktop heat.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat up olive oil to medium heat in a large pan or saucepan. You <strong>don't want</strong> the heat on high.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop the garlic and place it in the saucepan along with a sprinkle of chilli flakes.</li>
        <li>Add your cherry tomatoes, which should be diced into quarters.</li>
        <li>Halve the two larger tomatoes, then <em>carefully grate</em> each piece directly into the saucepan. Stir as necessary and let the sauce thicken. The sauce is ready when stirring with a wooden spoon leaves a line that slowly closes back up.</li>
        <li>By now, your pasta should be almost ready. Taste it to check if it's <em>just shy</em> of your desired doneness. This is where you add the pasta into the sauce, along with some pasta water to help the sauce better stick to the pasta.</li>
        <li>After adding the pasta into the sauce, add in your chopped basil, optionally leaving some for garnish, as well as grating in some fresh parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Plate and serve! Garnish with a bit of basil, extra parmesan cheese, and a dash of olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
