This is my first project's README file.
The project will deal with creating a basic recipe website, consisting of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
By completing this project I should have demonstrated the different skills I learned through TOP regarding HTML; this includes creating the basic html boilerplate, using the proper elements for a heading, link (also including security and privacy considerations), and anything else that might be relevant.
