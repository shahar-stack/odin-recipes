This is my first project's README file.
The project will deal with creating a basic recipe website, consisting of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
By completing this project I should have demonstrated the different skills I learned through TOP regarding HTML; this includes creating the basic html boilerplate, using the proper elements for a heading, link (also including security and privacy considerations), and anything else that might be relevant.


Reflection after having finished the basic HTML website:
It was definitely fun to make this, since I love cooking and was able to write out recipes I actually make use of. I did in fact demonstrate the things TOP covered in the HTML basics, regarding the basic boilerplate, the usage of different elements through paragraphs, images, lists, links etc.
I also went ahead and imported real images of the recipes that I've taken, as well as made a neat and simple gif for the main home page using Canva.
Looking forward to style this in the future.
